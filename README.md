# arduino_mavlink
An example library for interfacing mavlink with Arduino.
This library has been tested for interfacing with ArduPilot but should be easy enough to modify for use with Pixhawk or your own flight stack by changing the mavlink dialect.

Created using the great instructions at ```https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/mavlink-and-arduino-step-by-step/```

```
git clone --recursive git@github.com:AndersonRayner/arduino_mavlink.git
```

# Installation
Install the ```mavlink``` folder directly into your Arduino libraries folder.
Make sure to also pull the submodules for this to work (or clone with the --recursive flag).
